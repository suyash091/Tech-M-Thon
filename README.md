# Lab Authenticator
### UseCase2

This application is made with ReactNative and Firebase.<br>
It can easily be installed on all the major device like IOS/Android. <br>
The confidential and personal credentials of Firebase SDK can't be made public on GitHub. <br>
So before starting the project do consider theses installation instructions:

## Installation Instructions:

1. Make sure lates NodeJS version is available
2. Run npm install
3. Install expo-cli using npm install -g expo-cli
4. Create a file named firebaseConfig.js inside constants folder and paste in your own FireBase credentialsthat you get after creating your account on Firebase.
The file should be structured exactly like this: <br>
`import * as firebase from "firebase";` 
`const config = { apiKey: "***YOUR_KEY",`
`authDomain:"***YOUR_PROJECT_DOMAIN",` 
`databaseURL: "***YOUR_DB_URL***", `
`projectId: ""***PROJECT_ID***"",` 
`appId:"**APP_ID***", }; `
`firebaseConfig = firebase.initializeApp(config); export default firebaseConfig;`
For help visit: https://firebase.google.com/
5. For starting the app after completing the above steps, run: `npm start` 
to open up the expo-client in the browser then scan the QR code to download and run the application locally on your IOS/Android devices or emulators.

## Additional Setup:
Before testing out with the application, Add some Authenticated Users(required for signing in to the application) to Firebase.
Example:
email: pete@email.com 
password: 123456
userId: DZYztGsP6aZMc1kMg43QirCZSM13 (Unique Id automatically generated by Firebase Authentication)


The Firebase live database used in this application has a well defined schema. Do consider using this
schema for the proper functioning of the Application.
